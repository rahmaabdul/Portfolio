# Portfolio
In this file you'll find a portfolio that I have created and coded with a css style sheet and an index.html file.
I began with a simple code on the HTML document and developed it by adding more elements such as divs, sections, paragraphs and many headers. I'v also added a photo of myself followed by an alt tag to describe it. In the Css style sheet i have styled the page by adding background colour, different sizes and styles of fonts and sized images and borders. 

Here are some screenshots of the finished portfolio:

- header - I wanted to stick to a simple look with a solid background colour and text that shows my name and intro

- about me section - This is where you'll find an image of me next to a short paragraph about me

- message - this i where the visitor of my portfolio would leave a message and their details.

- footer - the portfolio ends with a message to thank the visitor along with a copyright claim.
